## 🚗 Final Assignment: Car Sales & Service Analytics (Excel + Cognos)

As the capstone project of the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I completed a two-part final assignment simulating the role of a **regional manager for a chain of car dealerships**. The goal was to analyze sales and service data, build visualizations, and deliver executive-ready dashboards.

### 🔹 Part 1: Excel Analysis
- Built pivot tables and charts to track:
  - Quantity Sold by Dealer ID
  - Profit by Date and Model
  - Profit by Year and Dealer ID
  - Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID
- Delivered a polished Excel workbook with **formatted KPIs and charts**.

### 🔹 Part 2: Cognos Analytics Dashboards
- Designed two interactive dashboards:
  - **Sales Dashboard**: KPIs for Profit, Quantity Sold, Quantity by Model, Average Quantity Sold, and Profit by Dealer ID.
  - **Service Dashboard**: Recalls by Model, Customer Sentiment (treemap), Profit vs Quantity Sold by Month, and Recalls by Model & System (heat map).
- Exported dashboards as a professional PDF report.

### 🏆 Certification
Successfully completing both parts earned me the **IBM Data Visualization with Excel and Cognos Analytics Certification**, validating my ability to move from **Excel-based analysis** to **enterprise BI dashboards**.
