# Final Assignment – Part 2 (Cognos Analytics)

## 📖 Overview
In Part 2 of the final assignment, I built **interactive dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics** to analyze both **Sales** and **Service** performance for a chain of car dealerships.  
This extended the Excel analysis from Part 1 into a **business intelligence environment**, showcasing my ability to design dashboards that support executive decision-making.

## 📝 Reflection
This part of the assignment demonstrated how to:
- Move from **static Excel charts** to **interactive BI dashboards**  
- Combine **KPIs, charts, and advanced visualizations** into a cohesive story  
- Use Cognos features like **navigation, formatting, and layout templates**  
- Provide executives with **both high-level KPIs and drill-down insights**  

Together with Part 1, this project shows my ability to deliver **end-to-end analytics**: from raw data → Excel analysis → Cognos dashboards → business insights.
