# Module 3: Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel & Cognos

## 📖 Overview
This module focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through **Excel charts** and **Cognos Analytics dashboards**.  
I practiced creating visualizations using different methods: automatic, manual, and with the Cognos Assistant.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Building dashboards with multiple panels in Cognos
- Using maps, radial charts, and packed bubble charts
- Leveraging Cognos Assistant for natural language–driven visualizations
- Formatting and customizing Excel charts for clarity

## 📂 Materials

## 📸 Sample Outputs
- Revenue and Quantity Sold by Location (map visualization)
- Product Line by Coupon Response (radial chart)
- Quantity Sold and Unit Cost by City (column + line chart)
- Department Sales by Loyalty Status (packed bubble chart)

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **visualization choices change the story**.  
For example:
- Maps highlight **geographic trends** in sales.  
- Radial charts reveal **customer response patterns**.  
- Bubble charts make **segment comparisons** intuitive.  

I can already see how these skills apply to real-world business problems, like analyzing hotel occupancy trends or customer loyalty in the Cameroonian market.
