# Module 3: Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel & Cognos

## üìñ Overview
This module focused on transforming raw datasets into **meaningful, interactive dashboards** using Excel and IBM Cognos Analytics.  
I learned how to create visualizations through different methods (automatic, manual, and with Cognos Assistant), and then advanced to building dashboards with **custom calculations, filters, and navigation paths**.

## üéØ Key Learnings
- Building dashboards with multiple panels in Cognos Analytics
- Creating visualizations using:
  - Automatic drag-and-drop
  - Manual chart selection and customization
  - Cognos Assistant (natural language queries)
- Designing interactive dashboards with:
  - Custom calculations (e.g., Margin = Unit Sale Price ‚Äì Unit Cost)
  - Keep/Exclude data point functionality
  - Top/Bottom filters (e.g., Top 10 cities by sales)
  - Navigation paths (Order Year ‚Üí Quarter ‚Üí Country ‚Üí City)
  - Tab-level filters for interactivity
- Formatting and customizing Excel charts for clarity and storytelling

## üì∏ Sample Outputs
- **Revenue and Quantity Sold by Location** (map visualization)  
- **Product Line by Coupon Response** (radial chart)  
- **Quantity Sold and Unit Cost by City** (column + line chart)  
- **Department Sales by Loyalty Status** (packed bubble chart)  
- **Average Revenue & Average Margin** summary cards  
- **Revenue by Product Line** colored by Location Code  
- **Top 10 Quantity Sold by City** column chart  
- **Margin by Order Year** with drill-down navigation

## üìù Reflections
This module was a turning point in my analytics journey.  
- I moved from **static visualizations** to **interactive dashboards** that support real decision-making.  
- I learned how to **choose the right visualization for the story**‚Äîmaps for geography, radial charts for customer response, bubble charts for segmentation.  
- Advanced features like **calculations, filters, and navigation paths** showed me how to make dashboards **dynamic and user-friendly**.  

I can already see how these skills apply to real-world problems, such as analyzing **hotel revenue trends** or **community engagement metrics** in Cameroon.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Add screenshots of dashboards to the `screenshots/` folder.  
- Apply these visualization techniques to real-world datasets (e.g., hotel occupancy, church chatbot engagement).  
- Continue refining storytelling skills by combining **Excel, Cognos, and Python visualizations** in later modules.
