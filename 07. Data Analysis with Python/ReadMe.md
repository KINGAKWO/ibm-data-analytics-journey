Module 7: Data Analysis with Python
Skills Applied
- Data loading & cleaning with Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary stats, visualizations, outlier detection
- Feature engineering and preprocessing for modeling
- Model development: train/test split, basic supervised models (regression/classification)
- Model evaluation & refinement: metrics, cross-validation, error analysis
- Project workflow: end-to-end notebook structure, reproducible analysis

Overview
This module focused on applying Python to real-world data analysis problems. I practiced loading and wrangling datasets, performing exploratory analysis, building and evaluating predictive models, and iterating on model improvements. The work includes guided review notebooks, hands‑on practice labs, and a capstone-style project (House Sales in King County).

How to run
- Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code / GitHub Codespaces.
- Install dependencies (typical): pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- Use the provided datasets in the same folder or update the file paths in the first code cell.
- Run cells sequentially; key sections are clearly labeled: Data Loading, EDA, Modeling, Evaluation, Conclusions.

Reflection
This module strengthened my ability to move from raw data to actionable models. Key takeaways:
- Clean data reliably before modeling — small issues in types or missing values can skew results.
- EDA drives modeling decisions — visualizing relationships and distributions guided feature choices.
- Iterative evaluation (metrics + visual checks) is essential for trustworthy models.
- The House Sales project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow suitable for portfolio presentation.
