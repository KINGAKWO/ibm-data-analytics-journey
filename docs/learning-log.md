## October 23, 2025 â€” Module 3: Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel & Cognos

### âœ… What I Completed
- Finished my first hands-on lab for **Data Visualization and Dashboards**.
- Built my **first Cognos dashboard** with multiple panels.
- Practiced different visualization methods:
  - Automatic (drag-and-drop fields into panels)
  - Manual (choosing chart types and customizing them)
  - Cognos Assistant (natural language queries to generate charts)
- Built an **Advanced Dashboard** in Cognos Analytics.
- Practiced advanced dashboarding techniques:
  - Creating custom calculations (e.g., Margin = Unit Sale Price â€“ Unit Cost).
  - Keeping/excluding data points from visualizations.
  - Applying **Top/Bottom filters** (e.g., Top 10 cities by Quantity Sold).
  - Creating **navigation paths** (Order Year â†’ Quarter â†’ Country â†’ City).
  - Adding interactive filters for Product Line.


### ðŸ“Š Key Outputs
- **Map visualization**: Revenue and Quantity Sold by Location  
- **Radial chart**: Product Line by Coupon Response  
- **Column + Line chart**: Quantity Sold and Unit Cost by City  
- **Packed bubble chart**: Department Sales by Loyalty Status
- **Average Revenue & Average Margin** summary cards.
- **Revenue by Product Line** colored by Location Code.
- **Top 10 Quantity Sold by City** column chart.
- **Margin by Order Year** with drill-down navigation.
- Interactive filters for Product Line selection.


### ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- Visualization is more than aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about **choosing the right chart to tell the right story**.  
- Maps revealed **geographic sales patterns** that would be invisible in tables.  
- Radial and bubble charts made **customer behavior and loyalty segmentation** easy to interpret.  
- I realized how dashboards can **support executive decision-making** by surfacing insights quickly.  
- This lab showed me how to move from **static dashboards** to **interactive, decision-ready dashboards**.  
- Calculations like *Margin* add **business meaning** beyond raw numbers.  
- Top/Bottom filters are powerful for **executive summaries**â€”they surface the most important insights quickly.  
- Navigation paths and drill-downs make dashboards **explorable**, which is critical for real-world business users.  

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Start thinking about how to apply these techniques to **real-world datasets**
