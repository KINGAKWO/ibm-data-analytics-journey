## October 23, 2025 â€” Module 3: Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel & Cognos

### âœ… What I Completed
- Finished my first hands-on lab for **Data Visualization and Dashboards**.
- Built my **first Cognos dashboard** with multiple panels.
- Practiced different visualization methods:
  - Automatic (drag-and-drop fields into panels)
  - Manual (choosing chart types and customizing them)
  - Cognos Assistant (natural language queries to generate charts)

### ðŸ“Š Key Outputs
- **Map visualization**: Revenue and Quantity Sold by Location  
- **Radial chart**: Product Line by Coupon Response  
- **Column + Line chart**: Quantity Sold and Unit Cost by City  
- **Packed bubble chart**: Department Sales by Loyalty Status  

### ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- Visualization is more than aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about **choosing the right chart to tell the right story**.  
- Maps revealed **geographic sales patterns** that would be invisible in tables.  
- Radial and bubble charts made **customer behavior and loyalty segmentation** easy to interpret.  
- I realized how dashboards can **support executive decision-making** by surfacing insights quickly.  

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Start thinking about how to apply these techniques to **real-world datasets**
