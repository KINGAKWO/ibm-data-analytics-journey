## January 16, 2026 — Module 7: Data Analysis with Python

### ✅ What I Completed
- Completed all labs and the final project for **Data Analysis with Python**.  
- Practiced **data loading, cleaning, and wrangling** with Pandas.  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on cars and laptops datasets.  
- Built and evaluated predictive models using **scikit-learn**.  
- Refined models with metrics, residual analysis, and cross-validation.  
- Delivered a **capstone-style project** analyzing **House Sales in King County, USA**.  

---

### 📊 Key Outputs
- Cleaned and transformed multiple datasets (cars, laptops, house sales).  
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and feature importance.  
- Developed regression models to predict housing prices.  
- Evaluated models with metrics such as R², MSE, and residual plots.  
- Iteratively refined models for improved accuracy.  
- Produced a reproducible notebook showcasing an **end-to-end workflow**.

### 💡 Reflections
- Learned how **data wrangling** directly impacts model performance.  
- EDA is critical for uncovering **hidden relationships** and guiding feature selection.  
- Model evaluation is not just about metrics—it’s about **trusting the model’s behavior**.  
- The **House Sales project** demonstrated how to move from raw data → insights → predictive modeling.  
- This module solidified my ability to handle **real-world datasets** and build **decision-ready models**.

### 🚀 Next Steps (Module 7)
- Apply these Python analysis techniques to **business datasets** (finance, retail, policy).  
- Begin preparing for **Module 8: Data Visualization with Python** to enhance storytelling with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
