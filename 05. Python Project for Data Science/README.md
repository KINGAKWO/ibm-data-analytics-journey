## 📖 Overview
In this module, I assumed the role of a **data scientist working for a hedge fund**.  
My task was to extract, clean, and analyze stock and revenue data to identify **suspicious activity or unusual trends**.  
I used Python libraries such as `yfinance`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `matplotlib` to build a complete financial dashboard for companies like **Apple (AAPL)**, **AMD (AMD)**, **Amazon (AMZN)**, **Tesla (TSLA)**, and **GameStop (GME)**.

## 🗂️ Labs Completed
1. **Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library**  
   - Created Ticker objects with `yfinance.Ticker()`  
   - Loaded company metadata from JSON files  
   - Extracted historical share prices and dividends  
   - Visualized stock trends over time  

2. **Final Assignment – Webscraping Lab**  
   - Downloaded HTML content using `requests`  
   - Parsed stock data tables with `BeautifulSoup`  
   - Extracted and structured historical Amazon stock prices  
   - Built a clean DataFrame for analysis  
   - Answered targeted questions about metadata and stock values  

3. **Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard**  
   - Scraped revenue tables for Tesla and GameStop  
   - Cleaned and aligned revenue data with stock timelines  
   - Created dual-panel visualizations comparing stock price vs. revenue  
   - Built a dashboard using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()`

## 📊 Summary
- **Data Acquisition**: Pulled stock data using `yfinance`; scraped revenue data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed currency symbols, handled nulls, and aligned timeframes.  
- **Analysis**: Compared stock performance against revenue growth to identify patterns and anomalies.  
- **Visualization**: Built dashboards with subplots to communicate insights clearly.

## 📝 Reflection
This module marked a turning point in my journey—from guided labs to a full analytics project.  
I learned how to:
- Use `yfinance` to access real-time and historical stock data  
- Parse JSON and HTML content for financial metadata  
- Clean and structure semi-structured data for analysis  
- Build dashboards that compare stock price and revenue trends  

The **web scraping lab** reinforced my ability to extract structured data from raw HTML and transform it into usable formats.  
The **final dashboard project** showcased my ability to combine multiple tools into a cohesive workflow—essential for real-world data science.

This project is a strong addition to my portfolio, demonstrating both technical execution and business insight.
