# Module 5: Python Project for Data Science

## 🏅 Skills Applied
- 🐍 Python Fundamentals  
- 📦 Pandas for data wrangling  
- 🌐 yfinance for stock data extraction  
- 📊 Data visualization with Matplotlib  
- 📈 Financial analysis using historical price trends  

---

## 📖 Overview
In this module, I assumed the role of a **data scientist working for a hedge fund**.  
My task was to extract and analyze stock data to identify **suspicious activity or unusual trends**.  
I used the `yfinance` library to pull metadata and historical price data for companies like **Apple (AAPL)** and **AMD (AMD)**.

## 🗂️ Labs Completed
1. **Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library**  
   - Created Ticker objects with `yfinance.Ticker()`  
   - Loaded company metadata from JSON files  
   - Extracted historical share prices and dividends  
   - Visualized stock trends over time  

2. **Final Assignment – Webscraping Lab**  
   - Downloaded HTML content using `requests`  
   - Parsed stock data table with `BeautifulSoup`  
   - Extracted and structured historical Amazon stock prices  
   - Created a clean DataFrame for analysis  
   - Answered targeted questions about metadata and stock values

## 📊 Summary
- **Data Acquisition**: Used `yfinance` to pull stock data into Pandas DataFrames.  
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parsed JSON files for company info (sector, country, market cap).  
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyzed price movements and volume trends from 1980 to present.  
- **Visualization**: Plotted stock price trajectories to detect growth patterns and anomalies.

## 📝 Reflection
This lab demonstrated my ability to **extract, analyze, and visualize financial data using Python**.  
I learned how to:
- Use `yfinance` to access real-time and historical stock data  
- Parse JSON metadata for company insights  
- Visualize long-term stock performance to detect trends and anomalies  

This project is a strong addition to my portfolio, showing that I can apply Python to **real-world financial analysis**.

The second lab(Final Assignment_Webscraping) reinforced my ability to **scrape structured data from web pages** and transform it into usable formats.  
I practiced parsing HTML tables, handling nested tags, and building a clean DataFrame for financial analysis.  
This skill is essential for analysts who need to work with unstructured or semi-structured data sources.
