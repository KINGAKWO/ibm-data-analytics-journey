## 📖 Overview
This module introduced **SQL fundamentals** for working with relational databases.  
I practiced creating tables, loading data from CSV files, and writing queries to manipulate and analyze data.  
The labs used **MySQL via phpMyAdmin** and **Datasette** to explore datasets such as HR records, Film Locations, and Pet Rescue.

## 🗂️ Labs Completed
1. **Simple SELECT Statements**  
   - Queried film location dataset with filters and column selection.  

2. **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**  
   - Practiced Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands on the Instructor dataset.  

3. **Create and Load Tables using SQL Scripts**  
   - Built a Cardio-Vascular Diseases (CVD) database from SQL scripts and CSV files.  

4. **String Patterns, Sorting, and Grouping**  
   - Used `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` to filter and organize HR data.  

5. **Built-in Functions**  
   - Applied aggregation (`SUM`, `AVG`), scalar (`ROUND`), string (`UCASE`, `LCASE`), and date functions (`DATEDIFF`, `DATE_ADD`).  

6. **Sub-queries and Nested Selects**  
   - Wrote sub-queries in `WHERE` clauses, column expressions, and derived tables.  

7. **Working with Multiple Tables**  
   - Accessed multiple tables using sub-queries and implicit joins.  

8. **Working with Joins in MySQL using phpMyAdmin**  
   - Practiced INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER joins on HR database tables.

## 📊 Summary
- **Data Acquisition**: Loaded CSV files into MySQL tables.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserted, updated, and deleted records.  
- **Analysis**: Queried across multiple tables using joins and sub-queries.  
- **Functions**: Applied built-in SQL functions for aggregation, string manipulation, and date calculations.  
- **Visualization Prep**: Grouped and sorted data for reporting and dashboards.

## 📝 Reflection
This module gave me **hands-on mastery of SQL fundamentals**.  
I learned how to:
- Create and populate databases from CSV files  
- Query across multiple tables with joins and sub-queries  
- Use aggregate and string functions to enrich analysis  
- Build clean, structured queries for real-world datasets  

SQL is now a solid part of my toolkit, enabling me to move seamlessly between **raw data storage** and **analytical insights**.
