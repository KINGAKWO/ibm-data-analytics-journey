This repository documents my **hands-on labs, exercises, and reflections** from the  
[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst).  

It serves as both a **learning log** and a **portfolio showcase** of my growth as a data analyst.  
Each module folder contains:
- Exercises and datasets (CSV/XLSX)
- Lab instructions (PDFs)
- Dashboards and visualizations (Excel & Cognos)
- A `README.md` with key learnings and reflections
