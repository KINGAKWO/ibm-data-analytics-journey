# Lab 5: Sets in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **sets**, a data structure used to store unique, unordered elements.  
Sets are powerful for deduplication and performing mathematical-style operations on collections.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating sets with `{}` and `set()`
- Understanding uniqueness and unordered nature of sets
- Performing set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
- Membership testing with `in` and `not in`
- Adding and removing elements from sets
- Practical applications: deduplicating lists, comparing categories, filtering unique values

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **sets simplify data cleaning tasks**.  
For example, converting a list of customer IDs into a set instantly removes duplicates.  
Set operations like union and intersection are also very useful when comparing datasets—for instance, finding common products sold across different dealers.
