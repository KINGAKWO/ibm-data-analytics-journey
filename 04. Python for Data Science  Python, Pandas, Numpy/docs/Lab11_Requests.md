# Lab 11: HTTP Requests in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab explored how Python interacts with web servers using the **requests** library.  
I practiced sending HTTP requests, inspecting responses, and handling JSON/text data.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Understanding HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`) and status codes
- Sending requests with the `requests` library
- Inspecting response headers, content, and encoding
- Parsing JSON responses with `.json()` and text with `.text`
- Handling errors using `.raise_for_status()`
- Applying HTTP requests to real-world scenarios (APIs, file downloads)

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **Python connects directly to the web**.  
I realized that HTTP requests are the foundation of API interactions, and mastering them allows me to pull live data, automate workflows, and integrate external services into analytics projects.
