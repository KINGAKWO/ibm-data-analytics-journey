# Lab 7: Loading Data into Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced techniques for loading external datasets into Python.  
I practiced reading CSV and Excel files, previewing data, and exploring dataset metadata.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Reading files with `open()` and context managers
- Using **pandas** to load data: `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_excel()`
- Understanding relative vs absolute file paths
- Previewing datasets with `.head()` and `.tail()`
- Inspecting dataset structure with `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Handling delimiters and missing values during load

## 📂 Files

## 📝 Reflection
This lab was my first step into **real data analysis with Python**.  
I realized how important it is to load data correctly—choosing the right delimiter, handling missing values, and checking metadata before analysis.  
This sets the stage for deeper work with **Pandas and NumPy**, where I’ll clean, transform, and analyze datasets.
