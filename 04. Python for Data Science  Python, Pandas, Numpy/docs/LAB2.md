# Lab 2: Strings in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab focused on working with **strings in Python**, covering creation, indexing, slicing, and built-in methods.  
It emphasized how strings are used in data cleaning and preparation tasks.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Declaring strings with single and double quotes
- Indexing and slicing substrings
- Using string methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`
- Concatenating strings and using escape sequences
- Formatting strings with f-strings and `.format()`

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **powerful and flexible Python strings are**.  
I realized that many real-world datasets require **string cleaning**—removing whitespace, standardizing case, or extracting substrings.  
These skills will be critical when I start working with **Pandas DataFrames**, where text columns often need preprocessing before analysis.
