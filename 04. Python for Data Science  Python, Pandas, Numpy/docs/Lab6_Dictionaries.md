# Lab 6: Dictionaries in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **dictionaries**, a data structure that stores information as key-value pairs.  
Dictionaries are widely used in data analytics for handling structured data, JSON objects, and mappings.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating dictionaries with `{}` and key-value pairs
- Accessing values by their keys
- Adding, updating, and deleting dictionary entries
- Using dictionary methods: `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
- Checking membership with `in`
- Working with nested dictionaries
- Iterating through keys, values, and items

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **flexible and powerful dictionaries are**.  
Unlike lists or sets, dictionaries let me store data in a way that’s easy to query by key.  
I realized how often dictionaries appear in real-world analytics—whether parsing JSON from APIs, building configuration files, or working with Pandas DataFrames.
