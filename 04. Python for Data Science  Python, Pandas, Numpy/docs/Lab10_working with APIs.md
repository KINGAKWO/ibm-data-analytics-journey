# Lab 10: Working with APIs

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced how to connect Python to external data sources using **APIs**.  
I practiced sending requests, parsing JSON responses, and extracting useful information for analysis.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Understanding APIs as data access points
- Using the `requests` library to send HTTP requests
- Parsing JSON responses into Python dictionaries and lists
- Extracting specific fields from API responses
- Handling errors with status codes and exceptions
- Applying APIs to real-world scenarios (e.g., weather, finance, text analysis)

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **powerful APIs are for analytics**.  
Instead of relying only on static CSVs, I can now pull **live data directly into Python**.  
I realized that APIs are essential for building modern data products—whether it’s dashboards, chatbots, or automated reporting pipelines.
