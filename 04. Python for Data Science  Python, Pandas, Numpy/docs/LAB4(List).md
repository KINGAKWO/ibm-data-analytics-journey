# Lab 4: Lists in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **lists**, Python’s most flexible and widely used data structure.  
Lists are mutable, making them ideal for storing and manipulating collections of data.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating lists with square brackets
- Indexing and slicing to access elements
- Mutability: adding, removing, and updating list items
- Common list methods: `.append()`, `.extend()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, `.reverse()`
- Nested lists and accessing elements within them
- Using built-in functions (`len`, `sum`, `max`, `min`)
- Iterating through lists with loops

## 📝 Reflection
This lab highlighted the **power and flexibility of lists**.  
Unlike tuples, lists can be modified, which makes them perfect for **dynamic datasets**.  
I realized how often lists will be used in real-world analytics—whether storing rows of data, cleaning text, or preparing inputs for Pandas DataFrames.
