# Lab 1: Getting Started With Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, expressions, and simple data structures.  
It also provided practice using Jupyter Notebooks as an interactive coding environment.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Declaring and assigning variables
- Performing arithmetic and logical operations
- Using built-in functions (`print`, `type`, `len`)
- Understanding Python data types: int, float, string, bool
- Introduction to lists and tuples
- Running and documenting code in Jupyter Notebooks

## 📝 Reflection
This lab gave me confidence in the **syntax and structure of Python**.  
I realized how intuitive Python is compared to other languages I’ve seen, and how Jupyter makes it easy to combine **code, output, and notes** in one place.  
This foundation will be critical as I move into **Pandas and NumPy** for data analysis.
