# Lab 3: Tuples in Python

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **tuples**, an immutable data structure in Python.  
Tuples are useful for storing fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, database records, or constant values.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating tuples with parentheses
- Accessing elements via indexing and slicing
- Working with nested tuples
- Understanding immutability and when to use tuples vs lists
- Performing tuple operations: concatenation, repetition, membership
- Using built-in functions (`len`, `max`, `min`, `sorted`)
- Packing and unpacking tuples into variables

## 📝 Reflection
This lab highlighted the **importance of immutability**.  
While lists are flexible and editable, tuples are ideal for **fixed data** that should not change.  
I also found tuple unpacking powerful—it makes code cleaner when working with multiple return values from functions.
