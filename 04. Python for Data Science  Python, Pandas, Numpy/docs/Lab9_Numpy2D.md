# Lab 9: NumPy 2D Arrays

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **2D arrays in NumPy**, which are essential for representing tabular data and performing matrix operations.  
I practiced creating, indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays, as well as applying aggregation functions.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating 2D arrays with `np.array()` and `np.reshape()`
- Indexing rows and columns (`arr[0, :]`, `arr[:, 1]`)
- Performing matrix operations with `np.dot()`
- Broadcasting operations across rows and columns
- Using aggregation functions (`np.sum`, `np.mean`, `np.max`, `np.min`) with `axis`
- Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()` and `.flatten()`
- Applying 2D arrays to tabular datasets and statistical analysis

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me how **NumPy 2D arrays form the backbone of data science workflows**.  
I realized that many datasets are naturally tabular, and NumPy provides efficient tools to manipulate them.  
Understanding broadcasting and axis-based aggregation is critical for scaling analysis to large datasets and preparing inputs for machine learning models.
