# Lab 8: NumPy 1D Arrays

## 📖 Overview
This lab introduced **NumPy**, the core library for numerical computing in Python.  
I practiced creating and manipulating 1D arrays, performing vectorized operations, and applying mathematical functions.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Creating arrays with `np.array()` and `np.arange()`
- Indexing and slicing arrays
- Performing vectorized arithmetic operations
- Using universal functions (`np.sqrt`, `np.exp`, `np.mean`)
- Inspecting array attributes: `.shape`, `.dtype`, `.size`
- Understanding why NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists

## 📝 Reflection
This lab showed me the **power of NumPy arrays** compared to Python lists.  
Vectorized operations make code cleaner and significantly faster, which is critical for large datasets.  
I realized NumPy is the foundation for **Pandas, SciPy, and machine learning libraries**, so mastering arrays is essential for my analytics journey.
